Notes: 

I tried to add the getRounds function into the while loop ex. while (getRounds > 0)
I didnt get any errors but I was having trouble decrementing the value in rounds because it wasn't
within the scope of the while loop itself

Current code:

int rounds = getRounds();

while (rounds > 0)
{
    //code does stuff

  rounds--; //increment round
}

The issue here is that I'm trying to update the value of rounds inside the loop but rounds
exists outside of it, I can't seem to update something outside of a loop from within.
I'm thinking maybe I should try a for loop

The for loop worked! It solved the decrement issue because I was able to set i to the value of 
getRounds!
